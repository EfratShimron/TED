##### TED: Temporal Differences (TED) Compressed Sensing

##### TED is a Compressed Sensing method for temperature reconstrcution from sub-sampled dynamic MRI data.

 ============================================

### What this code does:
This Matlab toolbox contains an implementation of the TED  algorithm [1] and demos with two datasets:
1. Gel phantom data (GE scanner).
2. Agar phantom data (Philips scanner).

In both cases, fully sampled data was acquired in-vitro and then retrospectively subsampled offline, so a reference temperature map is computed from the fully-sampled dataset.

TED is compared with two well-established methods: *l*1-SPIRiT [2] and the K-space Hybrid Method [3].

## Generalizability
Although we proposed TED for temperature reconstruction, In fact, TED is a *general* dynamic MRI method and can hence be implemented to other dynamic MRI applications, such as cardiac MRI.
If you find a cool implementation - let us know!

### Prerequisites
Matlab is required. The code was tested with Matlab2017R.

## Getting Started
Clone or download the code.


## Running the examples
Open the demo_start.m function in Matlab, choose one example from the following list, set the desired
reduction factor (R), and run the code.

## Gel phantom demo - expected output:

## Agar phantom demo - expected output:
